# Neuron â€” Brain Trainer (Next.js + Tailwind)

Quick start:

1. Copy files into a Next.js project folder (replace versions as needed).
2. Add actual audio files to `public/success.mp3` and `public/gameover.mp3` (open-source, small files).
3. Run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Built with the app router (`app/page.js`).
- Uses Tailwind CSS for lightweight styling.
- Uses the Vibration API and Audio API for feedback.
- Replace placeholder audio assets with proper open-license sounds before production.
